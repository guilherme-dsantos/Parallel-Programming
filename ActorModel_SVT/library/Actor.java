/*
 * The Actor model runs on one thread of execution, and it does not share its state with other actors.
 * Java does not enforce this second requirement, so it is up to the programmers.
 * An actor has a (synchronized) mailbox, which other actors know the end of it (Address)
 * In distributed environments, this address can be a socket (ip/port) or message queue.
 * Synchronization still needs to be made correct by the programmer, especially the complete workflow,
 * based on how each actor is programmed.
