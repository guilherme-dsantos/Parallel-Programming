## Knapsack GA

This repository is organized in three classes:

* knapsack.Main: This is the entrypoint to run the program. Your several versions of the program should be located here.
* knapsack.Individual: This represents each solution of the Knapsack problem, which can be mutated and crossed over with other solutions. *You are not supposed to change this file*.
* knapsack.KnapsackGA: This class is the sequential algorithm: it generates an initial population of 100000 random solutions/individuals. Then, through 500 generations, it selects the best ones, and crosses them to fill the population of the next generation. Then, there is a change the new individuals will be mutated. And the process repeats until all intended generations are completed.
