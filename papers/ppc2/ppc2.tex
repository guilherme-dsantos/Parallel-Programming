\maketitle

\noindent The strategy used was the Fork/Join framework because the algorithm provided is recursive, 
so it is possible to divide the set of coins into smaller parts and create sub-tasks to compute those same parts.
Regarding the granularity of the task, I tested the execution times with \texttt{index $\ge$ 15} and \texttt{getQueuedTaskCount() $>$ 2} and was able to conclude that with \texttt{index $\ge$ 15} the execution is faster. 
The best result I got was $\approx$ 0.082 seconds with 24 threads.
